# Curse Of Time

**Curse of Time** was a second-year group project built in Unreal Engine 4.26, where I took my first deep dive into Unreal C++. Itâ€™s a dungeon crawler hack-and-slash game featuring two core mechanics: a **dash** for fast movement and a **time warp** ability that lets the player rewind a few seconds of gameplay. Players can swap between two weapons, each with its own combat animations, while battling enemies from a cursed cult; all under time pressure.

## Contributions
- **Core Gameplay Systems**: Implemented the **time warp mechanic**, stamina system, and dash functionality.
- **Combat Architecture**: Designed a **flexible animation system** for weapons using a shared character skeleton to streamline animation reuse.
- **AI System**: Developed **enemy AI** using a Kung-Fu circle approach, managing enemy positioning and attack patterns to balance combat difficulty.
- **UI Programming**: Built the HUD and pause menu UI.
