I'm a massive star wars fan and around January of 2020 I started collecting star wars books in my free time but after collecting for a while it has become harder and harder to keep track of what books I had and what books I didn't have. So I decided to make a booklist for myself using C# .net and WPF using the MVVM model.

Since I have gained more experience I have become aware that this is not the best it could be and a rework is needed on the code structure and the GUI. So I plan on improving this project and start anew in which I would set up a server with a client.

I'm currently still using this project as a guide on what I have and what I don't have, but this project is far from feature complete and I'm planning to do a complete overhaul of the project.
The current version of this project is hosted on my [github](https://github.com/EnriqueBrosse/Booklist){:target="_blank"}.
