I'm a massive Star Wars fan, and in January 2020 I started collecting Star Wars books in my free time. As my collection grew, it became harder to keep track of which books I already owned, which ones I was missing. To solve this, I decided to build my own book tracking tool using C# .NET and WPF, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.

This tool helps me organize my collection with features like filtering by series, all in one semi responsive desktop application.

## Future Plans for the Book Collection Tracker

Since gaining more experience over the years, I've realized that the original structure of the project both the codebase and the GUI could be significantly improved. With that in mind, Iâ€™m planning a complete overhaul of the project.

The next version will include:
- **Server/Client Architecture**: Setting up a server to manage and sync my collection, with a lightweight client application for interaction.
- **Modernized UI/UX**: Rebuilding the GUI with a more intuitive and polished design.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Making it easier to expand beyond just Star Wars books if needed in the future.

Although the current version isn't feature complete, I still actively use it as my main tool for tracking what books I own and what I'm missing.
You can find the current version of the project hosted on my [github](https://github.com/EnriqueBrosse/Booklist){:target="_blank"}.
