# Hubris VR
Hubris is a VR action-adventure game set in a unique and colorful Sci-Fi universe, with immersive movement options, including swimming, climbing, and jumping. Players will have to gather resources, craft food and upgrade their weapons to fight off alien wildlife, droids, and humanoid enemies.

## My Responsibilities 

I joined Cyborn as a Tools and Pipeline Developer seven months before the game's Steam release, during active production. My work primarily focused on building internal tools using Unreal Engine and C#. As production wrapped up, I took over responsibility for the game's localization systems. During the Meta Quest 2 port, I developed a custom draw distance tool to optimize performance for standalone VR. I later handled the porting process to SteamVR (OpenVR) and integrated support for the Virtuix Omni One platform.


## Draw Distance Optimizer

This tool was developed in C++ to automatically optimize draw distances for UPrimitiveComponent instances in Unreal Engine. Its main purpose was to determine the maximum distance at which an object is rendered, and update the level accordingly to improve performance—especially on VR platforms like Meta Quest 2.

### Tool Overview 
The system consisted of three core components:

1. **Volume System**
    Our technical artist, [Daan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daanmeysman/){:target="_blank"}, would place *positive* and *negative* volumes in the level
    - **Positive volumes** defined regions where the system would evaluate visibility.
    - **Negative volumes** excluded areas from evaluation, allowing fine control over scan locations.
2. **Editor Utility Widget**
    A user-facing interface exposed configuration options, such as the spacing between scan points and debugging overlays that visualized evaluated positions in the level.
3. **Game Mode**
    A custom game mode controlled the actual scanning process using the following frame-based cycle:
    - **BeginPlay**: Fetch all predefined camera positions.
    - **Frame 1**: Move the camera to a new position with rotation (0, 0, 0).
    - **Frame 2**: Wait to ensure stable rendering (due to threading).
    - **Frame 3**: Check which UPrimitiveComponents were rendered using UPrimitiveComponent::WasRecentlyRendered(). If the observed distance exceeded the stored value, update it.
    - **Frame 4+**: Rotate the camera incrementally to simulate a cubemap view, repeating the render checks. Once the "cubemap" is complete, proceed to the next location (see frame 1).

Once all positions had been evaluated, the tool wrote the results to a JSON file mapping object names to their optimal draw distances. It would then advance to the next level in the batch. The JSON data could be re-imported via the widget to apply optimized distances directly in-editor.

### Foliage Optimization Extension
Later, the tool was extended to handle foliage. Since Unreal’s foliage system can spawn instances beneath geometry (making them never visible), this version focused on visibility checks only. It wrote the never rendered instances to a JSON file (with the location of the instance), allowing us to clean up unnecessary foliage and improve performance.

### Technical Challenges

Initially, the tool ran in-editor, and later in standalone builds. A significant challenge was managing Unreal Engine’s multi-threaded rendering and RHI systems. Visibility checks often returned inconsistent results across frames, requiring multiple wait states between frames to ensure accurate data. In retrospect, running the tool with [-OneThread](https://unreal-garden.com/docs/command-line-arguments/#onethread) might have mitigated some of these sync issues.

Due to complaints of nausea from the in-editor camera movement during tool execution, I eventually offloaded the process to our Jenkins CI server, where it could run headlessly and generate results without impacting the team’s experience.

## Porting 
- Ported Hubris to SteamVR (OpenVR)
- Ported Hubris to Virtuix Omni One (did not work on the actual Pico VR port) 

### SteamVR
The game was originally developed with the OpenXR runtime in mind, but after receiving significant community feedback, we needed to add support for the SteamVR (OpenVR) runtime.

**Porting Goals**:
- Enable both OpenXR and SteamVR runtimes within the same build.
- Preserve gameplay behavior and performance across both runtimes.

To meet the first requirement, I implemented a command-line argument system to control the active runtime. Within UnrealEngine.cpp, I added logic to parse a custom -HMDRuntime argument, allowing us to explicitly select the runtime. For example:

- HMDRuntime="OpenXRHMD" for OpenXR
- HMDRuntime="SteamVR" for SteamVR

This system defaults to the first available runtime based on enabled plugins but allows for flexible testing and packaging. Because OpenXR and SteamVR plugins conflict when loaded simultaneously, I ensured that enabling one would automatically disable the other at runtime via plugin configuration.

On the SteamVR side, I corrected input mappings and adjusted laser alignment to ensure consistent controller behavior.
A particularly challenging issue was related to re-centering: initially, the character's arms would visually glitch for several frames before snapping into place. I resolved this by refining the re-centering logic to preserve pose stability during runtime transitions.


### Virtuix Omni One 

This port was not that hard as the original port for the Pico was already done by [Wouter Beert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wouter-beert/){:target="_blank"}, the only thing that needed to happen was to rewrite part of the input to make sure that the player would move the same as the player was walking. When porting this we found out really early that we would need to add support to make running/walking speed faster then the user was walking/running as the levels were not made for using the Omni one, so we added extra options to make the user run faster while also still enabling controller support for the harder jumps. 


## Localization

Toward the end of the project, I took on responsibility for implementing localization. This involved ensuring that all translated content received from external localization vendors was correctly integrated into the game. Given the tight timeline leading up to release, manual data entry was not feasible. To streamline the process, I developed a custom tool in C# that parsed Microsoft Excel and CSV files and automatically imported the localized text into Unreal Engine.

This tool significantly reduced turnaround time and minimized the risk of manual errors. Later, during the development of Wall Town Wonders, we evolved this workflow further by transitioning the entire localization pipeline into Unreal Engine, allowing for more seamless integration and real-time validation of localized content.
