Hello there, I'm a pipeline and tools programmer with a passion for building smart, intuitive solutions that make teams' lives easier. I love developing tools that empower artists, designers, and developers to focus on their creativity while I handle the behind-the-scenes complexity.

Currently, I work with Unreal Engine and C#, building and maintaining tools, managing Jenkins pipelines, and designing robust CI/CD workflows to keep production running smoothly. I especially enjoy bridging the gap between creative and technical teams, making complicated systems feel seamless and approachable.

When I'm not scripting, building pipelines, or refining workflows, I'm a proud cat dad to two mischievous cats (Yoda and Gandalf) and a lifelong Star Wars fan. Whether it's troubleshooting a tricky toolset or rewatching The Clone Wars, I'm always excited to dive into what I love.
